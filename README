NAME
    Data::Dump::OneLine - Dump data structures as single-line strings

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.04 of Data::Dump::OneLine (from Perl
    distribution Data-Dump-OneLine), released on 2014-10-03.

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::Dump::OneLine qw(dump);

     $str = dump(@list);
     @copy_of_list = eval $str;

     # or use it for easy debug printout
     use Data::Dump::OneLine; dd localtime;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a fork of Data::Dump 1.22 which removes newlines in the
    output so the output is a single line. Aside from that, the whitespaces
    in the output are also minimized. If an output contains literal
    newlines, that is considered a bug. You can use this module just like
    Data::Dump.

SEE ALSO
    JSON should also encode to a single-line string, but some data
    structures (cyclical, contains globs or other special Perl data) cannot
    be encoded out of the box to JSON.

    Data::Dumper::OneLine strives to do the same for Data::Dumper, but last
    time I tried it (at v0.05) it's still buggy.
