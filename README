NAME
    Data::Dump::OneLine - Dump data structures as single-line strings

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.06 of Data::Dump::OneLine (from Perl
    distribution Data-Dump-OneLine), released on 2014-11-14.

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::Dump::OneLine; # exports dd and dmp
     $str = dd(@list);

DESCRIPTION
SEE ALSO
    JSON should also encode to a single-line string, but some data
    structures (cyclical, contains globs or other special Perl data) cannot
    be encoded out of the box to JSON.

    Data::Dumper::OneLine strives to do the same for Data::Dumper, but last
    time I tried it (at v0.05) it's still buggy.
